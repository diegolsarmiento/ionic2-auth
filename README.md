# ionic2-auth

Mobile development built using Ionic 2 for Hybrid development.

This seed repo serves as an Ionic 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Ionic 2 and Auth fast.
* API configuration was based on Python/Django/rest_auth. This app makes it extremely easy to build Django powered SPA's (Single Page App) or Mobile apps exposing all registration and authentication related functionality as CBV's (Class Base View) and REST (JSON). For more info check [Tivix](https://github.com/Tivix/django-rest-auth).

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v4.6.1`+) and NPM (`3.10.9`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Developing

After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

# TypeScript

> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor

I have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 11+](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)
